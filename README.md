# 🐍 Python Cheatsheet

This document is meant to serve as a **concise summary of core Python concepts and syntax** — a quick reference for people who already have some familiarity with the language.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
> This cheatsheet is **not intended to be a comprehensive learning guide or tutorial** (although it tries to be as complete and clear as possible). It’s more of a structured overview for those who already understand the basics of Python and want a well-organized refresher.
